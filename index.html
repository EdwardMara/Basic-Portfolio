                    <p>Besides, you look good in a dress. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Ensign Babyface! You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Sorry, Data. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Your shields were failing, sir. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. What? We're not at all alike!</p>
                    
                    <p>You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I'll be sure to note that in my log. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I am your worst nightmare! What? We're not at all alike! How long can two people talk about nothing?</p>
