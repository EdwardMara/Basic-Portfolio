                        My name is Edward Mara, but most people just call me Jimmy.  I am based out of Seattle, WA, but was born and raised in Flower Mound, TX.  I am a budding web developer who moved to the area to accumulate knowledge and build a network of like minded colleagues.  The oppurtunities and experiences I have had, and hope to have, here are bringing me closer to realizing my goal of starting a career in which i can build and create things that make a difference in other people's lives.

                        I follow many sports, but baseball and football are my favorite.  I like to play golf, watch Star Trek, and play games in tabletop or virtual forms.
