I came into this project with a general knowledge of computer science and html.  Building the "skeleton" in html posed little challenge to me.

However, I used this project to practice proper git practices such as how to add, commit, and push to the proper repository.  I now see how commiting and pushing often with proper comments can utilize version control functions properly as well as nurture a productive collaborative environment.

The most challenging and time consuming part of this initial draft of my portfolio was by far the css.  Formatting the elements to the specifications of the assignment properly started as a daunting task.  Through various online resources, collaborating with classmates, and the help of my instructors, I was able to build a satisfying project.
The inspect tool in google chrome proved especially helpful towards the tail end of my project.
